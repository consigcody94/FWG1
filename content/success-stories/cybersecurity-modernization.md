## Challenge

The agency faced increasing cybersecurity threats and needed to modernize their security infrastructure to meet NIST 800-53 requirements. Legacy systems made threat detection slow and incident response inefficient.

## Solution

FWG implemented a comprehensive security modernization program:

- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Deployed 24/7 monitoring solution
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrated advanced threat detection systems
- **Incident Response**: Established rapid response procedures
- **Compliance Framework**: Implemented NIST 800-53 controls
- **Training Programs**: Conducted security awareness training for all staff

## Results

The modernization dramatically improved the agency's security posture:

- **Reduced Incidents**: 75% reduction in security incidents
- **Faster Detection**: Threat detection time reduced from 4 hours to 10 minutes
- **Full Compliance**: Achieved 100% NIST 800-53 compliance score
- **Improved Response**: Incident response time cut by 60%
- **Better Visibility**: Real-time security dashboards for leadership

The agency now has a robust, modern cybersecurity infrastructure that protects against evolving threats.
